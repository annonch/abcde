\begin{abstract}
  With the growing interest in cryptocurrency in the last decade, an increasing number of industries are developing solutions that take advantage of the decentralized platform that blockchain facilitates.
  %The emergence of blockchain technology started with the release of a whitepaper penned by an anonymous author under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto \cite{btc-whitepaper}.
  %This whitepaper entitled \textit{Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System} was instramental in the creation of a mainstream electronic currency.
  %Bitcoin was pivotal in the implementation of a distributed ledger which serves as the database for transactions and balances.
  %While cryptocurrency and blockchain offers many promising solutions, the financial industry is vast and complex and it is not trivial to incorporate existing financial securities and derivatives into the decentralized blockchain environment.
  %This document proposes the exploration of integrating and implementing existing financial derivatives and so-called cryptocurrency derivatives into blockchain technology through simulation and modeling.

% At a minimum you need to supply the author names, year and a title.
% IMPORTANT:
% Full first names whenever they are known, surname last, followed by a period.
% In the case of two authors, 'and' is placed between them.
% In the case of three or more authors, the serial comma is used, that is, all author names
% except the last one but including the penultimate author's name are followed by a comma,
% and then 'and' is placed before the final author's name.
% If only first and middle initials are known, then each initial
% is followed by a period and they are separated by a space.
% The remaining information (journal title, volume, article number, date, etc.) is 'auto-generated'.

%In this appendix, we measure
%the channel switching time of Micaz [CROSSBOW] sensor devices.
%In our experiments, one mote alternatingly switches between Channels
%11 and 12. Every time after the node switches to a channel, it sends
%out a packet immediately and then changes to a new channel as soon
%as the transmission is finished. We measure the
%number of packets the test mote can send in 10 seconds, denoted as
%$N_{1}$. In contrast, we also measure the same value of the test
%5mote without switching channels, denoted as $N_{2}$. We calculate
%the channel-switching time $s$ as
%\begin{eqnarray}
  %\end{eqnarray}%
%By repeating the experiments 100 times, we get the average
%channel-switching time of Micaz motes: 24.3$\mu$s.
